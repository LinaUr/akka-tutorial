We tried to configure the serializer binding for Akka StreamRefsProtocol and our Message Classes to use the java
serializer and also the akka-stream-ref serializer ( akka-stream-ref "akka.stream.serialization.StreamRefSerializer")
(serializer binding e.g.: "akka.stream.impl.streamref.StreamRefsProtocol" = java)

For some reason, the worker decides to always use the Kryo Serializer nonetheless,
which results in a deserialization error in the master who receives the message.
This is just a Warning and not an error still, the master cannot register the worker and it results in a Kryo Exception.


The two important warning outputs have been screenshotted and are placed in the issues_images folder.

Sadly, although we really tried hard, we have not found a solution and would appreciate advice and/or help.
